# SnakeGame

This is a Snake Arcade Game. I coded it 2018 October 20, according to UdemyCourse of Christian Gesty / 
JavaFX - Java Programme mit Oberfl√§chen / GUIs erstellen.
I made some exchanges in Appearance and GamePlay, but didn't change the really raw state of development.
Here are the main differences:
-- I added sound for Events (hitting the wall, eating the apple)
-- I changed the way the apple is reset: originally it may occur, that the apple is set behind the snakes body, so it won't show,
   until the snake moved on. In my version it will only be set on an unoccupied field.
-- I changed four buttons into two toggle buttons.
-- I added some functionality to the gameplay, esp. with 'P' you can toggle the music play on/off.

I like to credit http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons for wonderful Icons.
I like to credit, well, now I'm embarrased, cause I can't find the website any more. 
So I like to thank for the music loop, called hide-and-seek. It is the perfect sound for a lazy afternoon.
